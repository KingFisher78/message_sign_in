# Message

For this project, you'll build a simple CMS for a blog, based on the website Medium.

## Part 3

Users should be able to:

1. Sign in
2. Add responses to posts

You have complete latitude for how `responses` should be modeled and desgined. Your only constraint is that responses should show up at the bottom of a post's show page. You might want to check out <a href="https://medium.com/">https://medium.com/</a> for examples
